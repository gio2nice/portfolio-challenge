# Portfolio-Challenge

The main goal for this project was to organize sections with flexbox to make your portfolio look neat.

## Github Deployed Link

The following link demonstrates my website()

## Description
 My application gives you information about "Giovanni", his contact and project experiences. i applied aside section to be able to add on an image of myself without having to position every box. The main problem i faced was not being able to clearly see the hover color over the boxes & it still does not show.

## Comments
I need extra help on adding hover and aligning-text in the center for footer.
